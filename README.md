# MatrixCalculator

A project that allows for calculating matrix operations. I started this for my Systems Fundamentals course and added more to it.

Here is what I needed to implement for the project
- Matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transpose
- Conversion from infix to postfix and evaluating postfix to solve expressions
- Binary search tree to find named matrices
- Dynamic memory management (malloc/free) to save matrices
- File reading to parse the scripts
